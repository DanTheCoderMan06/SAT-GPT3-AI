# Background Information
GPT-3 is the most recent and advanced AI algorithm publically available for use. It was developed by Open-AI, and is the 3rd Version of their GPT AI. The SAT on the other hand is decades old, and a traditional way of grading students based on intelligence and ability to solve tasks.
# What does my program do
Automatically creates problems with one or two steps, division addition subtraction or multiplication, and feeds it to GPT-3. I then record values such as the type of the question, the steps in the question, etc.
# How does it work?
You have to download the ZIP Version and extract it to your desktop. Afterwords you have to insert a list of OpenAI keys into the open AI to avoid sending too many API Requests. Finally, you just wait until the data-set is done, and the last part of the code runs statistical tests which for Example find the correlation between steps and how well GPT-3 did.
